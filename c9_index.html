				<p>Ice cream is a popular dairy product among consumers of all ages. Textural attributes of ice are the key factors determining the market success of the product. Ice cream is a dairy aerated dessert that is frozen prior to consumption. It is a microcrystalline network of liquid and solid phases. It contains air cells entrapped in liquid phase and various other components like proteins, fat globules, stabilizers, sugar, soluble and insoluble salts are also present in this phase. It is a complex physicochemical and colloidal system consisting on many complex ingredients that affect ice cream structure both in positive and defective functionality. Both stabilizers and emulsifiers improve the texture of ice cream by enhancing its viscosity and limiting the movement of free water molecules but their excess may cause the lower melting and less whip ability. As sugar provides sweet taste, improves thickness as well as bulkiness but on other hand its excessive use can turn ice cream into soggy structure above solid contents of about 42%. One of its compositional contents, fat, also exerts good effects on body, texture, palatability, flavor intensity, emulsion formation and maintenance of melting point. If fat contents exceed a specific usage concentration they cause faster meltdown of ice cream along with destabilization and agglomeration of fat droplets. Higher overrun results in collapsing of air cells ultimately shrinkage of structure occurs. Hardness might also reduced as a result of smaller ice crystals due to high overrun values. Fiber addition causes the binding of free water hence flow rate get reduced and consistency coefficient as well as viscosity enhanced. Binding of water results in less availability of its molecules; freezing point rises and melting point decreases. It is much critical to control the balance ice cream properties by maintaining its structure, texture and body. It is a best carrier for fruit fiber, chunks, purees, paste, concentrates; milk and whey isolates and concentrates; egg, egg yolks and their products; different flavorings, nuts, chocolate, probiotics and yogurt. So far, it is important to maintain its solid contents and structure with balanced proportion of ingredients.


Dairy product prepared by pasteurization, homogenization, aeration and freezing 
that has been maintained at uniform consistency is called ice cream. It is cheap, healthy, nutritious and palatable product.
 Composition of ice cream is comprised of sugar, fat, emulsifiers, stabilizers, water, egg and eggs products, corn syrup, dextrose and flavors. 
 It is a three phase network consisting on air, solid and liquid in final product. Liquid phase contains ice crystals in embedded form and air cells in 
 dispersed form. Milk proteins, soluble and insoluble salts, fat particles, stabilizers and sugars are also present in liquid phase. So it is a very complex
 physiochemical food system. Ice cream is categorized in dairy frozen desserts in which frozen confections, water ice, sherbet, frozen custard, parevine like products, ice milk and mellorine are included. According to U.S standards, ice cream must be consisted of not < 20% MSNF and 10% fat from milk while when flav
ors added in bulk than there should be 16% MSNF and 8% fat. Stabilizers should not be > 0.5%.</p>
